Castle Clash is a 2D side-view tower defence game developed for the Intel DE1-SoC FPGA. The game features real-time projectile motion, collision detection, and custom sprite animations, all rendered using a VGA display. Player input is managed through a PS/2 keyboard, while the game logic is implemented in C and executed on the Nios II processor. The game highlights the efficient use of interrupts, low-level hardware programming, and graphics handling on an FPGA platform.

Features:

Custom 2D graphics and animations
Real-time physics and collision detection
VGA display integration
